# What is this
This repository serves as a template/demonstration on how to make code easy for others to use--build, run and examine outputs.  

This demonstration is focused on machine learning.  However, feel free to adapt this to other data intensive applications (e.g., simulation, optimization, big data, etc.).  
* Config files are stored in ./config.
  * Using config files is optional but helps with reproducability (you can check new YAML files, compare them, etc.)
* Data is loaded from ./data/\<dataset\>
* Results are written to ./models/\<dataset\>/\<model\>
* Source code is in ./src.  
  * ./src/data has code for data processing
  * ./src/models has code for machine learning
* Other files (environment.yml, Dockerfile, etc.) are for setup

The repo. also has some tutorial material on conda, pandas, sklearn, docker, etc.  Feel free to ignore those for other applications.  See sections with "TUTORIAL/reference" below for more details.

## More details (read only once or when referring back)
Documentation makes sure your code can be build, run and understood by others.  

Keep this question in mind when you write a README.md: "If I was on vacation or sick, can my colleague/co-worker build and run my code?"  

More specifically, at a minimum cover the following points in a README.md.
1. How to build the code including any installation of libraries, conda environments, etc.
1. How to run the code with different datasets or parameters
1. How to examine the results
1. EXTRA but good to have: expected output and time to run each step
1. EXTRA EXTRA: how to extend the code for new datasets, parameters, models, etc. See "How to go further" below.
1. EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA: What calls, what, etc. The format of datasets and parameters can also be described.

# One time setup
Conda simplifies python package management and environment isolation.  It lets you easily install packages and avoid conflicts across projects; it also make projects more reproducible/portable.

This will set up a conda environment.
````
conda env create -f environment.yml -n python_project_template
````

# Everytime setup and cleanup
This will activate the conda environment.
````
conda activate python_project_template
````
The terminal prompt will have the python_project_template as a prefix like so:  ````(python_project_template) username@machineName:directoryName$````

Do this when done:
This will deactivate the conda environment.
````
conda deactivate
````
python_project_template should remove itself from the prompt like so: ````(base) username@machineName:directoryName$````

Updating the conda environment file:
Do this when you install a new package.
````
conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml
````

# Running

## Overview
1. Data setup/preprocessing
1. Training
1. Testing
1. Examining results

## Data setup/preprocessing
Split data into training and testing splits.  

This reads from data/\<dataset\>/raw and writes to data/\<dataset\>/processed (X_train, y_train, etc.).
````
cd src/data
python preprocess_data.py
````

## Training
Run the training, training.py.

This reads from data/\<dataset\>/processed (X_train, y_train, etc.) and writes to models/\<dataset\>/\<model\> (y_train_pred.csv, etc.)  

This should take less than 2 minutes on laptop purchased within the last few years of 2025.

To change the dataset, use the --dataset option.  
To use a config file, use the --config option.
````
cd src/models

python training.py
# different dataset
# python training.py --dataset="pima"
#
# using config files
# python training.py --config ../../config/iris_decision_tree.yaml
#
# how to generate a sample config file: python training.py --print_config > sample_config.yaml 
#
# you can also do python training.py --help
````

## Testing
Run the testing, testing.py.

This reads from data/\<dataset\>/processed (X_test, y_test, etc.) and writes to models/\<dataset\>/\<model\> (y_test_pred.csv, etc.).  

This should take less than 2 minutes on laptop purchased within the last few years of 2025.

To change the dataset, use the --dataset option.  
To use a config file, use the --config option.
````
cd src/models

python testing.py
# different dataset
# python testing.py --dataset="pima"
#
# using config files
# python testing.py --config ../../config/iris_decision_tree.yaml
#
# how to generate a sample config file: python testing.py --print_config > sample_config.yaml
#
# you can also do python testing.py --help
````

## Examining results
Look at models/\<dataset\>/\<model\>/y_test_pred.csv.  
It should look like this:
````
2.0
1.0
3.0
````
Be sure to include results in aggregate, not just a few datapoints.
E.g., On average, it is 75% correct.  (Other performance metrics are â€¦)

# OPTIONAL: Using Docker
Docker goes beyond conda by isolating the entire system environment, not just Python packages. E.g., docker can be used to isolate NVIDIA CUDA.

It makes a single container that runs consistently across any platform. This makes Docker good for deploying applications, testing across environments, and ensuring true reproducibility.

## One time setup, build the docker: 
````docker build -t python_project_template . -f Dockerfile````

This will build a docker image with the tag "python_project_template" using files in . and the instructions in Dockerfile.

You'll see something like this:
````
[+] Building 0.1s (6/6) FINISHED                                                                         docker:default
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                               0.0s

 => => naming to docker.io/library/python_project_template                                                         0.0s
````

## Everytime setup and cleanup
## ````docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/host python_project_template:latest /bin/bash````
* This will run an interactive terminal with the docker image "python_project_template", with the tag latest.
* It will be removed when you type "exit" in the docker instance.
* It will also mount local files as volume to the docker instance.  This means the docker instance can read and write local files.

"python_project_template:latest" is the tag of the docker image

"-it" means runs an interactive terminal

"-rm" means remove the docker container when it exits

"-v" is to mount a volume.  The current working directory is mounted as a volume in the docker container.  Any changes you make to the files in docker appear on the host and vice versa (if you don't mount the host, changes are temporary)

"bin/bash" is the program to run after the docker comes up

You'll see something like this: ````(base) root@10cc2bd02adc:/host#````.  This means you are inside the docker instance.

## Go back to "One time setup" above

## Do this when done: ````exit````

## Work in progress (WIP)
### Getting the conda environment up and running in the Docker
````
docker build -t python_project_template_conda -f ./Dockerfile_conda .
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/host python_project_template_conda
````
The conda environment is built but is not automatically activated.
Can go to "Everytime setup and cleanup" above

# TUTORIAL/reference for conda

## Installing conda
Go [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html).  For step one choose "Anaconda Distribution installer for Linux".

## Creating an environment
````
# new one
conda create --name myenv 
# specify the python version:
# conda create --name myenv python=3.11.9

# from a file
conda env create -f environment.yml -n myenv
````

## Installing packpages: conda install \<pkg\>
Common ones
````
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib

conda install -c conda-forge keras

conda install -c conda-forge opencv-python 
# if it fails, do pip install opencv-python

conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn

conda install -c conda-forge ultralytics # YOLO
conda install pytorch::torchvision
````

If conda does not upgrade, use pip instead.  E.g.
````
conda remove jsonargparse
pip install jsonargparse
````

## Examine what packages are installed: conda list

## Remove a package: conda remove \<pkg\>

## Exporting to a file
````
conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml
````

## Seeing what environments there are: conda env list

## Removing an environment: conda env remove --name \<env\>

# TUTORIAL/reference for jsonargparse

See [this link and their Github repo](https://speakerdeck.com/stecklin/jsonargparse-say-goodbye-to-configuration-hassles).  They use object-oriented programming (OOP).  It detracts the reader a little from simple uses of jsonargparse but can be helpful for greater modularity.
